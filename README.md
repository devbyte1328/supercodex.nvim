# supercodex.nvim

# This project is a work in progress. this README is currently for development purposes:

SuperCodex is a Neovim plugin that integrates and streamlines the use of local and online LLMs for coding purposes.

## Setup
> [!NOTE]
> This documentation does not cover how to host a local language model or how to obtain credentials for a cloud‑based LLM service. Those steps are the responsibility of the user.  
> The plugin itself is built to use an OpenAI‑compatible API endpoint. It follows the standard OpenAI API specification for all request/response formatting and authentication, so any endpoint that implements that interface will work seamlessly with the plugin.
